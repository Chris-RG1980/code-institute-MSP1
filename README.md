## Wire-frames
During the development phase of the desktop home page, I encountered a challenge while attempting to accommodate all of the necessary information on the screen, as depicted in the corresponding wire-frame. It was at this point that I realised I had inadvertently modified the size of the desktop wire-frame template, this granted me additional screen space within the wire-frame. Consequently, I had to reconsider my design approach for the desktop version, aiming to enhance its flow and generate more vertical space to accommodate the content more effectively. This adjustment has allowed for a design resembling the mobile design but also displays the information in a way that the user can quickly scan and locate the point of interest, adding to the user experience.

## Typography and Colour Scheme
### Typography
For the body of the website, the legible Source Serif 4 font has been selected from Google Fonts. Its modern appearance enhances the overall aesthetic while maintaining readability across various devices and screen sizes. 

![Image](resources/source-serif-4.png)

To ensure consistent rendering across platforms, Arial has been chosen as the Web-safe font. This familiar typeface acts as a reliable fallback option, ensuring that the content remains accessible even if the users device does not support the preferred font.

In situations where both Source Serif 4 and Arial are unavailable, the browser will default to the Sans-Serif font family, ensuring that the text remains clear and easily readable. 

The Signika Negative has been used when creating the logo. The Courgette font is used within the main heading creating a balanced and visually engaging look that enhances the overall design of the website.

By utilising these fonts strategically, the project achieves a distinct and memorable brand identity. 
### Colour Scheme
In this project, the colour palette has been selected to achieve a modern and clean aesthetic.

## Accessibility
To enhance visibility for individuals with visual impairments, the selected colour palettes offers contrast. Additionally, descriptive alternative text has been provided for all images used on the website. This inclusion allows screen readers to accurately convey the visual information to users who rely on auditory assistance. Also the accessibility of interactive elements is created by labelling all links and form elements appropriately.
