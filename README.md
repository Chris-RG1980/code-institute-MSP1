### Accessibility
To enhance visibility for individuals with visual impairments, I have selected color palettes that offer contrast. This deliberate choice enables better readability and comprehension of the content. Additionally, I have taken great care to provide descriptive alternative text for all images used on the website. This inclusion allows screen readers to accurately convey the visual information to users who rely on auditory assistance. Furthermore, I have ensured the accessibility of interactive elements by labelling all links and form elements appropriately.

## Typography and Color Scheme
### Typography
For the body of the website, the elegant and legible Source Sans Pro font has been selected from Google Fonts. Its refined and modern appearance enhances the overall aesthetic while maintaining readability across various devices and screen sizes.

To ensure consistent rendering across platforms, Arial has been chosen as the Web-safe font. This familiar typeface acts as a reliable fallback option, ensuring that the content remains accessible even if the users device does not support the preferred font.

In situations where both Source Sans Pro and Arial are unavailable, the browser will default to the Sans-Serif font family, ensuring that the text remains clear and easily readable. 

The Signika Negative has been used when creating the logo. The Courgette font is used within the main heading creating a balanced and visually engaging look that enhances the overall design of the website. 

By utilizing these fonts strategically, the project achieves a distinct and memorable brand identity. 
### Color Scheme
In this project, the color palette has been selected to achieve a modern and clean aesthetic that is both visually pleasing and aligned with the preferences of the target audience.

## Wireframes
During the coding process for the desktop home page, I encountered a challenge while attempting to accommodate all of the necessary information on the screen, as depicted in the corresponding wireframe. It was at this point that I realized I had inadvertently modified the size of the desktop wireframe template, this granted me additional screen space within the wireframe. Consequently, I had to reconsider my design approach for the desktop version, aiming to enhance its flow and generate more vertical space to accommodate the content more effectively. This adjustment allowed me to create a more cohesive and user-friendly desktop layout.
